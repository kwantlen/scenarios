Scenario planning is not a means of forecasting or predicting the future; rather, it’s a way of recognizing that the future is inherently unpredictable. But at the same time we need think imaginatively about what the future might hold. If we don’t, that future may surprise us in very unpleasant ways. As Nobel laureate [Thomas Schelling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Schelling) notes:\r\n\r\n> There is a tendency in our planning to confuse the unfamiliar with the improbable.\r\n> The contingency we have not considered seriously looks strange; \r\n> what looks strange is thought improbable; \r\n> what is improbable need not be considered seriously.\r\n\r\nA scenarios project seriously considers the unfamiliar, the strange, and the improbable. The process leads to a number of divergent narratives of possible futures as a way of grappling with driving forces that we cannot control. By using creative and imaginative approaches to narrative creation, we can learn to adjust our organization to survive and thrive within the context of future change. In this way we build organizational resilience and what [Nassim Nicholas Taleb](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb) has called _Antifragility_.\r\n\r\nThe outcome of a scenarios project is not the production of a scenario plan but rather a set of possible and plausible scenarios, narratives of futures that might impact our organization. But the scenarios outcome is, in many ways, secondary to the process itself: wondering, ruminating, imagining. The process engages the community in a broad discussion about difficult but important issues and themes that are infrequently discussed but which are pivotal in the life of the organization.\r\n\r\nThe Kwantlen scenarios project was initiated as a way to create a set of stories of divergent futures but also to engage Kwantlen’s broad community in a series of courageous conversations. In service of that goal, the scenarios are presented here, in the public sphere, as digital narratives designed for contribution.\r\n\r\nContributing, Versioning, Reimagining\r\n-------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe scenarios can be downloaded by clicking one of the links above, or they can be reviewed and modified on [GitHub](http://github.com), a tool for online collaboration.
