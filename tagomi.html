<h1 class="title">Tagomi’s Scenario</h1>

<p>A broad shift in global economics is underway. The turbulence of unconstrained
markets has been harnessed, finally, by industrial movements focused on
efficiency and scale. The scrabbling of nations for control of natural
resources has given way to fully corporate strategies and practices. The water
wars continue but are contained regionally. Global warming has brought more
drought and more competition. Health care and educational initiatives are
globalized, corporate, and focus on the integration of social roles with
economic contributions. The employment status of citizens determines their
access to education from an early age. Students and educators are universally
employees of corporations. In most of North American and Asia, the delivery of
educational programs is streamlined and integrated by one large corporate
stakeholder, the Cinnadella corporation. Continuing through the spectrum of
adult learning, each Cinnadella employee works with a sustained and customized
learning portfolio that matches and serves their employment role. The goals of
educators and the initiatives of employees are fully integrated with corporate
culture.</p>
<p>With few exceptions, education is an employment initiative paid for by
employees and sponsored by Cinnadella. The connected themes of career skill and
personal development have become integrated into corporate models at every
level. Systematic approaches to lifelong employment are the key drivers of the
education system.</p>
<p>All former post-secondary institutions were integrated into Cinnadella more
than 20 years ago. The four campuses of the former Kwantlen Polytechnic
University now serve as corporate offices. The former Langley campus serves as
Cinnadella’s Centre for Desalination and the former Surrey campus is the Centre
for Business Alignment. The two other former campuses, Cloverdale and Richmond,
remain true to their original purpose: the former Cloverdale campus is
Cinnadella’s corporate hub south of the Fraser, and the former Richmond campus
is the centrepiece of Cinnadella’s School of Design.</p>
<p>Credentialing, admissions, and transfer services are integrated at Cinnadella,
which handles the complexities of a global post-secondary system.
Internationally, broad-based agreements between Cinnadella and other corporate
institutions allow for online and in-person opportunities for employees to
build their educational profiles and to follow career opportunities.
Cinnadella’s educational programs are focused on market efficiency and
industrial development. The historical, cultural and personal themes that
traditional universities once cherished are not aspects of the programs
Cinnadella provides.</p>
<p>At Cinnadella, lifelong learning means lifelong employment. We’ve learned —
from the economic upheavals of 2014 and 2019, from the water wars that plagued
us in the twenties — that the essence of global stability is corporate
governance. Cinnadella offers an extensive array of programs that offer a
multitude of ways for employees to fuse educational plans with career
activities.</p>
<p>Instructors at Cinnadella widely view their role — at every level — as founded
upon principles of corporate management and employee support. Content is
ubiquitous and available for a fee. The role of educators is to contextualize
content within the corporate structure and to work with employees to codify
their learning by way of practical application. Technology facilitates much of
this process. With broadband access approaching 100 percent (except in some
areas still affected by the heat storms of the last decade), employees initiate
their Digital Educational Portfolios upon initial employment. Portfolios are
maintained throughout the life of each employee and serve to document their
achievements. Grades are tied to employment performance and efficiency.
Portfolios are the property of Cinnadella.</p>
<p>Recreation and leisure activity are not viewed as foundational to the overall
health of the society. Rather, corporate performance is the key to all personal
success. The health crises of the twenties and thirties — when the lives of
millions of people were shortened by preventable diseases of lifestyle — have
mostly been replaced by broad corporate initiatives to reduce stress and
burnout. Technology Attachment Disorder (TAD) is evident in about 30 percent
of the population in British Columbia. The main symptom of TAD — an inability
to communicate face-to-face — is a consequence of the corporate imperative for
intensive digital engagement and virtual activity. Thus, while technology is
a cornerstone feature of the delivery of educational programs, Cinnadella
recognizes that technology immersion cannot be the sole method of employment
participation. However, no alternatives yet exist.</p>
<p>In the lower mainland, most people live in large housing complexes with
attached medical clinics, care facilities, and schools. Most of these
facilities are operated by Cinnadella or its subsidiaries. Virtual travel is
the norm for employees at every age. Schools act as nodes for virtual
interaction within a wide network of employee activities that extend beyond the
school itself. The classroom is a meeting place for employees and a project
space to work on corporate projects. The educator helps to prioritize,
streamline, and develop the experiences of employees. Educational models focus
on efficiency, performance, and economic outcomes. For employees today, the
classroom is Cinnadella, the school is their way of improving economic
viability, and the educator is a manager.</p>

<h1>A Day in the Life of an Employee</h1>
<p>It is midnight. Tagomi Caréz wakes up, rubs her eyes, and in a moment of
disorientation wonders if she is back at the landfill. She can smell the acrid
air, and she listens for the sounds of the trucks – all night, all day, every
night and every day. But she does not hear the sounds of the trucks; no, just
the quiet whirr of fans shuttling air in and out of her room. And the smell? A
sense memory, nothing more. A legacy of youth spent wandering mazes of
detritus, searching for that one glittering thing that would save them all from
servitude. She never found it, of course – no one did – but she did get out.
Eventually, and after many trials and false starts, she found her way to
Highcastle, the educational arm of the Cinnadella Corporation.</p>
<p>Tagomi leans toward the retinal scanner, waits for the system to check for
outstanding infractions or fines, and logs in. She scans the most recent
timestamps in her academic passport: 59 hours this week so far. She’s getting
closer. Maybe a month more. Someone rolls over in bed in the next room – little
Frank, maybe, or Juliana. It’s crowded in there with four kids and two small
beds; no wonder there’s so much jostling and moving about at night. But not for
much longer, Tagomi hopes. They’ve already come a long way in a few short
years: away from the landfill, across the mountains to the city, and into a
housing hub where they can at least have a chance. Her parents died in the
shadow of that implacable monstrosity – Cinnadella Corporation Landfill 26 –
but Tagomi won’t. Nor will her kids.</p>
<p>She sees the path clearly in her mind’s eye. Another year of down-payments for
the Highcastle Entrepreneurship degree, then the rest is simple interest. A
lifetime of it, sure; but in Tagomi’s mind it’s a fair price. And five years of
service for Cinnadella with their cola plants in Africa won’t be so bad either.
It’s a good deal for the equivalent in tuition. She’s been serving the same
master for a long time, making these kinds of deals, inching her way toward
something she can’t quite see and can’t quite imagine: a better life, more
freedom, less urgency. She thinks she’s closer now, certainly closer than what
might otherwise have been. At least she has the ability to buy an education.
Between daytime work and nightime studying she is just able to make a go of it.
Her parents weren’t so lucky.</p>
<p>Besides, the cost for completion of this phase is not so high. Africa will be
interesting. She’ll have her choice of cities where she can virtually serve out
her time without having to leave her home, her family, and her friends. And the
kids appreciate the sacrifices and choices she is making – at least on a day
when everyone is feeling generous. But most days they just keep moving,
crunching through the next tasks and tallies, trying to grab the light wherever
they can find it.</p>
<p>Frank and Juliana have already started to think about their own paths. Early
days yet, but Tagomi thinks the kids might make it even farther ahead than
their mother. Frank, her eight-year-old, has started looking at virtual living
in various places. He probably will never leave the city in which they live,
but Tagomi hopes he will at least see the last of the shore birds at Boundary
Bay. They’re almost all gone now. Tagomi understands that Frank will spend most
of his life roaming in virtual space. And he might even go to Highcastle.
Juliana, for her part, wants to go. She’s been working for a few years, since
she was six, doing odd virtual jobs and stock data entry. She’d like something
new, something with a future. As for the twins, they’ve still got a few years
before Cinnadella will find a use for them.</p>
<p>Tagomi hears a plane rumble overhead, on its way to somewhere or from
somewhere. It doesn’t matter much these days – to or from – it’s all the same.
Everything in one place. At least, one virtual place. Tagomi thinks about some
of the cities she might visit in that virtual world: Singapore, Colombo, New
Oslo. She wonders about the final achievement of her degree and the
opportunities it might bring. She hopes for more freedom, more choice. The will
and the power to make her own life. Not many people can do that anymore. But
maybe she can.</p>
<p>Tagomi reflects on her interaction yesterday with President Frink. Although
she’s read many of the President’s daily updates and has participated in a
number of year-end forums, yesterday was Tagomi’s first opportunity to
participate in a virtual seminar with the President of Highcastle. The seminar
was only open to employees in the final year of their program. With her
holo-band on in her apartment, Tagomi had the familiar sensation of sitting in
a virtual space – in this case, Dr. Frink’s office in the Cinnadella
Presidentium in Bangalore. She and Robert, an older employee from Cascadia, sat
beside one another and shared an excellent view of the city. They could see the
half-lowered flags along the river, to commemorate the hundredth anniversary of
the Pearl Harbor attacks. Although Tagomi knows that President Frink is
incredibly busy supervising an educational conglomerate with more than four
million employees, professors and guides, the President made each of the
seminar students feel welcomed and appreciated. He gave each of them a small
digi-scroll with the following words written upon it:</p>
<blockquote>
There is a tendency in our planning to confuse the unfamiliar with the
improbable.  The contingency we have not considered seriously looks
strange; what looks strange is thought improbable; what is improbable need
not be considered seriously.</blockquote>
<p>As Tagomi reflected on these words, trying to figure out what they meant – are
they a message, a puzzle, a directive? – Robert noticed a chess board near the
window. He gazed at the pieces for a moment, then offered a move. President
Frink quickly offered a counter-move, and the gathered party joined the game.
It was fun for Tagomi, a sign of what her future might hold, a talisman.
She wants more of this – more of the unfamiliar and the improbable.</p>
<p>But right now she needs to get moving. She has only an hour to finish preparing
her presentation on landfill efficiency. At four AM local time the virtual
group will gather and the employee presentations will begin. Tagomi needs to
make some final edits. She needs this presentation to stand out. Her professor,
Rudolf Cho, will attend the virtual classroom today. If she wants to impress
him, Tagomi’s presentation needs to be perfect.</p>
