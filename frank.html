<h1 class="title">Frank’s Scenario</h1>

<p>A broad shift in global and local economics is underway. The turbulence of
unconstrained markets has been harnessed, finally, by industrial movements
focused on regional efficiency and autonomy. In Canada, individual provinces
control their natural resources and corporate practices. The water wars
continue but are contained regionally. Global warming has brought more drought,
but also a greater focus on local solutions. Health care and educational
services are also regionally focused and are delivered through governments
working with corporate partners. Students integrate their educational
activities with their economic contributions. Employment is almost universally
required for students to pay for tuition. Educators are typically corporate
employees and work mostly through the efficient means of virtual space. In
British Columbia, the delivery of educational programs is streamlined and
integrated by one large corporate stakeholder, the Cinnadella corporation.
Continuing through the spectrum of adult learning, each Cinnadella student
works with a sustained and customized learning portfolio. The goals of
educators and the initiatives of students are partly integrated with corporate
culture, but vestiges of the traditional university culture remain.</p>
<p>With few exceptions, education is sponsored by Cinnadella in exchange for
service to the corporation. The connected themes of career skill and personal
development are integrated into the educational system and reflect corporate
values. Systematic approaches to lifelong learning serve to enhance the
employment prospects of individual students.</p>
<p>All former post-secondary institutions in BC were integrated into the
Cinnadella University Partnership (CUP) more than 20 years ago. The four
campuses of the former Kwantlen Polytechnic University still serve as
educational hubs. The former Langley campus serves as CUP’s Centre for
Desalination and the former Surrey campus is Highcastle Manor, a student
residence. The two other former campuses, Cloverdale and Richmond, remain true
to their original purpose: the former Cloverdale campus is CUP’s corporate hub
south of the Fraser, and the former Richmond campus is the centrepiece of CUP’s
School of Design.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education and Cinnadella work together closely and are, in many
ways, indistinguishable. Credentialing is managed by the Ministry and matching
services are provided by CUP. Admissions and transfer services (the former
BCCAT, now long gone) are integrated at CUP, which handles the regional
complexities of an integrated provincial, federal and global post-secondary
system. Internationally, broad-based agreements between CUP and other corporate
institutions allow for online and in-person opportunities for students to build
their educational profiles and to follow career opportunities. CUP’s
educational programs are focused on market efficiency and industrial
development but also encourage personal exploration and discovery. The
historical, cultural and personal themes that traditional universities once
cherished are somewhat in evidence at CUP but are not foundational to its
purpose.</p>
<p>At CUP, lifelong learning means lifelong integration between education and
employment. We’ve learned — from the economic upheavals of 2014 and 2019, from
the water wars that plagued us in the twenties — that the essence of global
stability involves the synthesis of corporate governance and social
development. CUP offers an extensive array of programs to meet these goals, and
students pursue a multitude of educational activities.</p>
<p>Instructors at CUP widely view their role — at every level — as founded upon
principles of student virtual support. Content is ubiquitous and available for
a fee. Tuition is prohibitively expensive unless students contract with
Cinnadella for loans and service in kind. The role of educators is to
contextualize content within the corporate structure and to work with students
to codify their learning by way of practical application. Technology
facilitates much of this process. With broadband access approaching 100 percent
(except in some areas still affected by the heat storms of the last decade),
students initiate their Digital Educational Portfolios upon initial enrollment.
Portfolios are maintained throughout the life of each employee and serve to
document their achievements and goals. Portfolios are the property of students
but are also available to Cinnadella for purposes of employment review.</p>
<p>Recreation and leisure activity are viewed as important but not foundational to
the overall health of the society. Rather, corporate allegiance is the key to
personal success. The health crises of the twenties and thirties — when the
lives of millions of people were shortened by preventable diseases of lifestyle
— have mostly been replaced by broad corporate initiatives to keep students
involved in productive activities. Technology Attachment Disorder (TAD) is
evident in about 30 percent of the population in British Columbia. The main
symptom of TAD — an inability to communicate face-to-face — is a consequence of
the educational imperative for intensive digital engagement and virtual
activity. Thus, while technology is a cornerstone feature of the delivery of
educational programs, CUP recognizes that technology immersion cannot be the
sole method of student participation.</p>
<p>In the lower mainland, most people live in large housing complexes with
attached medical clinics, care facilities, and schools. Most of these
facilities are operated by Cinnadella or its subsidiaries. Virtual travel is
the norm for employees at every age. Schools act as nodes for virtual
interaction within a wide network of student activities that extend beyond the
school itself. The classroom is a meeting place for students and a project
space to work on educational projects. Virtual educators help to prioritize,
streamline, and develop the experiences of students. Educational models focus
on efficiency and performance as well as personal development. For students
today, the classroom is CUP, the school is their way of maximizing economic and
personal development, and the educator is a virtual guide.</p>
<div class="section" id="a-day-in-the-life-of-a-student">
<h1>A Day in the Life of a Student</h1>
<p>Frank Nobusuke and his friend Juliana are reclining on the lumpy sofa in
Frank’s dorm room, discussing their upcoming convocation events. Neither really
wants to attend these formal celebrations of their achievements, but both of
their families have insisted. Educational milestones, after all, are important.
When Frank’s parents came to Canada twenty years ago from Norway to work for
the Cinnadella Fish Farming Group, they brought their socialist ideas about
education with them. Although they are a simple middle class family and
unable to pay the exorbitant tuition fees charged by the CUP, Frank’s family
encouraged him to work toward qualifying for one of the employer-sponsored
seats in the Singh School of Entrepreneurship (SSE). Frank slogged away at his
online sales job with Coastal Tourism and earned a sponsored space in the
company’s credential program in Advanced Ecotourism. The sponsorship allows him
to work four days each week but also to attend school one day a week and on
evenings. Frank also qualified for a basic dorm room in the newly-constructed
Highcastle Manor. Entirely built from recycled plastics, Highcastle is popular
among eco-zealots, but Frank thinks it has a strange, acrid smell – almost as
though it was built atop a landfill.</p>
<p>Frank initially thought he’d be bored in the Eco program, but his involvement
in the mandatory service learning project has piqued his interest. Frank has
helped to map the migration and survival patterns of the birds at Boundary Bay.
In some ways, he’s begun to follow the paths of his parents: working with
nature, close to the ocean, advocating for the right balance between humans and
the sea.</p>
<p>Juliana reminds Frank that tomorrow is the last meeting of their student
cohort. They will both miss those afternoons hanging out in the Singh Student
Learning Centre, lazing on the faux-leather seats in the atrium, working on
group projects, listening to Dr. Tagomi regale them with stories of crazy
tourists and awe-inspiring hikes. All the stories are in the video archive, of
course, but Frank still enjoys hearing them in person. Besides, Dr. Tagomi is
free and open with her stories, whereas each video viewing costs Frank just a
little bit more of his dwindling reserves of capital. Dr. Tagomi has the same
kind of schedule as Frank: Monday to Thursday at the Tourism Secretariat, SSE
on Fridays for tutorials. But all this is about to change, Frank realizes: soon
he will be moving on.</p>
<p>But how much of a community is he moving on from, really? Many of his courses
have taken place online, and Frank is aware that he has met, in person, perhaps
20 percent of the graduating class. Sure, he’s seen them all online – seen a
few of them way too much, in fact – but there are always differences between
the virtual and the real. He’s not sure he knows any of them all that well
except for Juliana, who also lives in Highcastle and who, like Frank, is
probably going to be paying off tuition for the rest of her life.</p>
<p>Frank asks Juliana if some of the virtual tutors will be at convocation. She’s
not sure; most of them work from home and don’t attend campus much. Besides,
it’s quite possible that some of them will have course responsibilities at the
same time as convocation. It would be a shame, Frank muses, not to see Dr.
Childan, who was a great virtual tutor. He told stories, like Dr. Tagomi, but
Childan’s stories were usually about the past, about the ebb and flow of
history, about how we repeat so many of our past mistakes without realizing
what we are doing. Frank is sure that if Childan is at the convocation he will
take pains to point out to everyone that it is the hundredth anniversary of the
Pearl Harbor attacks. It’s one of Childan’s favorite stories: how the Americans
never imagined an attack was possible, how they ignored the warning signs, and
how they were eventually devastated by the precise planning of the Japanese.
Juliana likes that story too. In fact, she posted the famous Schelling
quotation about the attack as a persistent post on her wall display. Every
morning, after the display wakes her and scrolls through the trajectory of her
day, Juliana sees the last, insistent reminder. It says:</p>
<blockquote>
There is a tendency in our planning to confuse the unfamiliar with the
improbable.  The contingency we have not considered seriously looks
strange; what looks strange is thought improbable; what is improbable need
not be considered seriously.</blockquote>
<p>Frank is not sure how the next phase of his life will unfold. He doesn’t know
how he will pay off his educational debt, and he isn’t sure he wants to work
for Cinnadella for the rest of his life. But at least he has choices, and a
curious temperament, and after tomorrow a credential that will set him on his
way. He lies back, gazes at the ceiling, and wonders about his future.</p>
