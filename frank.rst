Frank’s Scenario
================


Frank Frink and his friend Juliana are reclining on the lumpy sofa in Frank’s dorm room, discussing their upcoming convocation events. Neither really wants to attend these formal celebrations of their achievements, but both of their families have insisted. Educational milsetones, after all, are important. When Frank’s parents came to Canada twenty years ago from Norway to work for the BC Fish Farming Group, they brought their socialist ideas about education with them. Although the Frinks are a simple middle class family and unable to pay the exorbitant tuition fees charged by the GTU (Group of Three Universities), Frank’s family encouraged him to work toward qualifying for one of the employer-sponsored seats in the Singh School of Entrepreneurship (SSE). Frank slogged away at his online sales job with Coastal Tourism and earned a sponsored space in the company’s credential program in Advanced Ecotourism. The sponsorship allows him to work four days each week but also to attend school one day a week and on evenings. Frank also qualifies for a basic dorm room in the newly-constructed Highcastle Manor. Entirely built from recycled plastics, Highcastle is popular among eco-zealots, but Frank thinks it has a strange, acrid smell – almost as though it was built atop a landfill.

Frank initially thought he’d be bored in the Eco program, but his involvement in the mandatory service learning project has piqued his interest. Frank has helped to map the migration and survival patterns of the birds at Boundary Bay. In some ways, he’s begun to follow the paths of his parents: working with nature, close to the ocean, advocating for the right balance between humans and the sea. 

Juliana reminds Frank that tomorrow is the last meeting of their student cohort. They will both miss those afternoons hanging out in the Singh Student Learning Centre, lazing on the faux-leather seats in the atrium, working on group projects, listening to Dr. Tagomi regale them with stories of crazy tourists and awe-inspiring hikes. All the stories are in the video archive, of course, but Frank still enjoys hearing them in person. Besides, Dr. Tagomi is free and open with her stories, whereas each video viewing costs Frank just a little bit more of his dwindling reserves of capital. Dr. Tagomi has the same kind of schedule as Frank: Monday to Thursday at the Tourism Secretariat, SSE on Fridays for tutorials. But all this is about to change, Frank realizes: soon he will be moving on.

But how much of a community is he moving on from, really? Many of his courses have taken place online, and Frank is aware that he has met, in person, perhaps 20 percent of the graduating class. Sure, he’s seen them all online – seen a few of them way too much, in fact – but there are always differences between the virtual and the real. He’s not sure he knows any of them all that well except for Juliana, who also lives in Highcastle and who, like Frank, is probably going to be paying off tuition for the rest of her life.

Frank asks Juliana if some of the virtual tutors will be at convocation. She’s not sure; most of them work from home and don’t attend campus much. Besides, it’s quite possible that some of them will have course responsibilities at the same time as convocation. It would be a shame, Frank muses, not to see Dr. Childan, who was a great virtual tutor. He told stories, like Dr. Tagomi, but Childan’s stories were usually about the past, about the ebb and flow of history, about how we repeat so many of our past mistakes without realizing what we are doing. Frank is sure that if Childan is at the convocation he will take pains to point out to everyone that it is the hundredth anniversary of the Pearl Harbor attacks. It’s one of Childan’s favorite stories: how the Americans never imagined an attack was possible, how they ignored the warning signs, and how they were eventually devastated by the precise planning of the Japanese. Juliana likes that story too. In fact, she has posted the famous Schelling quotation about the attack as a persistent post on her wall display. Every morning, after the display wakes her and scrolls through the trajectory of her day, Juliana sees the last, insistent reminder. It says:

     “There is a tendency in our planning to confuse the unfamiliar with the improbable. 
     The contingency we have not considered seriously looks strange; 
     what looks strange is thought improbable; 
     what is improbable need not be considered seriously.”
