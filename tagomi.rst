Tagomi’s Scenario
=================


It is midnight. Tagomi Caréz wakes up, rubs her eyes, and in a moment of disorientation wonders if she is back at the landfill. She can smell the acrid air, and she listens for the sounds of the trucks – all night, all day, every night and every day. But she does not hear the sounds of the trucks; no, just the quiet whirr of fans shuttling air in and out of her room. And the smell? A sense memory, nothing more. A legacy of youth spent wandering mazes of detritus, searching for that one glittering thing that would save them all from servitude. She never found it, of course – no one did – but she did get out. Eventually, and after many trials and false starts, she found her way to Runciter.

peers into the bedside retinal scanner. After the mandatory criminal records check and a fines scan, she gains access to the portal and continues work on her Life-long Passport in Entrepreneurship. Although she has some mouths to feed - a family to tend to - she is honoured that she still has the opportunity to get an education and experience enlightenment.  She understands from her parents that previous generations weren’t so lucky.  Families like hers, living in the largest landfill in Cuba, wouldn’t have had the opportunities Tagomi has had to study through Optimum.  But now even in El Botadero there is WIFI and everyone has a free access point, so even Tagomi can be connected with Optimum students from around the world. 

The cost for completion of this phase of her passport is not so high.  The period of i-Servitude she will serve after graduation working for Coca-Cola on their African cola-colonization campaign will be interesting. She’ll have her choice of African cities where she can virtually serve out her five years, without having to leave her home, her family or friends. Her two children are already helping to decide where they will serve their time.  Bo, her eight-year old, has discovered a new site where anyone can virtually live anywhere for a week and that may help make their choice of cities that much easier.  Tagomi would like to choose somewhere where her children can also contribute to their new i-community. 
Tagomi looks forward to a time when she will be free to ply her entrepreneurial trades as she sees fit and not be dependent on the WorldGov for support.  Once this happens she’ll be able to think about bridging her credential into one of the corporate post-baccalaureate programs.  But that will mean some late nights studying.
Tagomi reflects on her interaction yesterday with President Bhatti.  Although she’s read many of the President’s daily blogs and even participated in a number of her year-end i-Forums, yesterday was her first opportunity to participate in one of the V-Sems, open only to students in the final year of their program. The i-experience itself was fascinating.  With the Holo-band on, Tagomi felt like she was sitting in Dr. Bhatti’s office in the Presidentium in Bangalore. Even though she could see the panopticon on the wall behind the President, Tagomi felt like she was really there with the President and 9 other students.  She and Gia, a woman from the newly established city-state of Cascades on the edge of the Pacific Ocean, really hit it off.  They’ve arranged to continue their conversations about personal waste management systems off-online. 
Although she knows that President Bhatti must be an incredibly busy woman supervising an educational conglomerate with 1.5 million students, 500 professors and 30,000 educational guides, she made each of the V-SEM students feel like they had her total attention, and that she had a personal feel for what their concerns might be at this point in their education.   
Tagomi realized she had to shake off her thoughts of yesterday and get moving.  She only had a half hour to finish preparing for her upcoming service learning class on scenarios.  She has some final edits to make to the Virtual Scenarios she has prepared for the Landfill Governance Group of the Americas.  Everyone is presenting their VS’s today in the crit-class, so next week they can be presented to the clients.  Their professor, Aanglan Cho, will be present in the virtual classroom today, so if she wants to impress Dr. Cho, her VS’s need to be perfect.
