        <h3>Welcome to Kwantlen’s Scenario Planning Pages</h3>

<p>The scenario planning methodology is a disciplined and rigorous way to think 
about the future — especially aspects of the future that may have an impact on 
our success. Scenario planning is not a means of forecasting or predicting the 
future; rather, it’s a way of recognizing that the future is inherently 
unpredictable. But at the same time we need to think imaginatively about what 
the future might hold. If we don’t, that future may surprise us in very 
unpleasant ways. As Nobel laureate <a 
	href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Schelling">Thomas 
	Schelling</a> notes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is a tendency in our planning to confuse the unfamiliar with the improbable.
The contingency we have not considered seriously looks strange; 
what looks strange is thought improbable; 
what is improbable need not be considered seriously.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A scenarios project seriously considers the unfamiliar, the strange, and the improbable. The process leads to a number of divergent narratives of possible futures as a way of grappling with driving forces that we cannot control. By using creative and imaginative approaches to narrative creation, we can learn to adjust our organization to survive and thrive within the context of future change. In this way we build organizational resilience and what <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb">Nassim Nicholas Taleb</a> has called <em>Antifragility</em>.</p>

<p>The outcome of a scenarios project is not the production of a scenario plan but rather a set of possible and plausible scenarios, narratives of futures that might impact our organization. But the scenarios outcome is, in many ways, secondary to the process itself: wondering, ruminating, imagining. The process engages the community in a broad discussion about difficult but important issues and themes that are infrequently discussed but which are pivotal in the life of the organization.</p>

<p>The Kwantlen scenarios project was initiated as a way to create a set of stories of divergent futures but also to engage Kwantlen’s broad community in a series of courageous conversations. In service of that goal, the scenarios are presented here, in the public sphere, as digital narratives designed for contribution.</p>

<h2>Contributing, Versioning, Reimagining</h2>

<p>The scenarios can be viewed or downloaded by clicking the links at left, or 
they can be reviewed and modified on <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>, a 
tool for online collaboration. Feel free to create your own versions of these 
scenarios by using GitHub (forking, branching, and sending pull requests, if 
you are geeky); or by downloading the source files and sending your updates <a
