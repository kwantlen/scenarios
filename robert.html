<h1 class="title">Robert’s Scenario</h1>

<p>A broad shift in global politics is underway. The turbulence of unconstrained
markets continues but is mediated by broad agreement about the provision of
basic human needs. The landscape of education is still adjusting to the
Equitable Acquisition to Education Treaty (EAET), signed my most nations in
2035. The treaty mandates that most post-secondary education will not be funded
from tax dollars.</p>
<p>The scrabbling of nations and corporations for control of natural resources
continues. Health care and educational initiatives are focused on global
approaches that emphasize collaboration between governments and the corporate
sphere. In British Columbia, the delivery of educational programs is stratified
based on economics. Post-EAET multinational corporations, such as Cinnadella,
provide bursary programs for employees and are directly involved in the
delivery of post-secondary education to their student employees (termed
<em>clients</em>). Employees thus have relatively cost-effective access to
post-secondary education, but those not so lucky to be employed pay exorbitant
tuition fees. In many ways, corporations have supplanted the role that
governments once played in funding education. Revenues to support such funding
are now collected by way of employment as opposed to taxation, but otherwise
the situation is similar.</p>
<p>Technological change has transformed the delivery of educational services.
Interactive technology platforms offer opportunities for the integration of
educational systems around the world and provide opportunities for widespread
institutional and corporate collaboration. Educational clients travel
seamlessly across national borders. Many post-secondary institutions are
integrated into massive communities based on the alignment of specialized
programming (MIT and India Institute of Technology, for example, which formed a
single unit in 2032). Linkages to multinational corporations such as Cinnadella
are the norm and are required for individual economic viability. Various
configurations exist, but each shares the common element of stratification and
global reach.  At the same time, global universities constantly seek ways to
anticipate niche trends and to work with industry to develop programs to
address changing needs.</p>
<p>Educational offerings are increasingly customized to meet the demands of
clients and their employers. Universities assess students only within the
specific context of an employment outcome. Credentialing structures award
designations based on individually negotiated outcomes (involving active
employer involvement) as opposed to predetermined programs or degrees.
Employer-specific credentials are common (the Cinnadella Bachelor of Web
Development, for example).</p>
<p>Beginning in kindergarten and continuing through the spectrum of adult
learning, each client works with a sustained and customized learning portfolio.
The goals of educators, employers, and students are closely entwined. The
delivery of educational services through technology requires few professors or
teaching assistants. The assessment of client projects is managed by data
processing services. Where professors of teaching assistants are required, they
need not be co-located with clients.</p>
<p>A few traditional Liberal Arts universities remain (three on the West Coast of
the Americas). These institutions serve only the wealthiest clients and are the
training grounds for many of the corporate elite. Many aspiring clients are
attracted to these schools, but the rate of acceptance is vanishingly small.</p>
<p>The connected themes of career skill and personal development have become
integrated into educational models at every level. Systematic approaches to
lifelong learning and employment are the key drivers of the education system.</p>
<p>The four campuses of the former Kwantlen Polytechnic University now serve as
corporate offices for the Cinnadella Corporation. Virtual education has
rendered campuses unnecessary. The former Langley campus serves as Cinnadella’s
Centre for Corporate Agility and the former Surrey campus is the Centre for
Business Alignment. The two other former campuses, Cloverdale and Richmond, are
now transit hubs.</p>
<p>Admissions and transfer services for educational clients are integrated
globally at Highcastle, a worldwide centre for niche program tracking and
credentialing. From their offices in Oslo, Highcastle handles the complexities
of client movement through an integrated, global post-secondary system.</p>
<p>Educators widely view their role — at every level — as founded upon principles
of client support and corporate facilitation. Content is ubiquitous and
available to clients for free (but at a cost to others). The role of educators
is to contextualize content within the corporate structure and to work with
clients to codify their learning by way of practical application.  Educational
portfolios are maintained throughout the life of each client and serve to
document their achievements. Grades are tied to employment performance and
efficiency. Portfolios are the property of the niche provider (Cinnadella,
typically, or one of its competitors).</p>
<p>Recreation and leisure activity are viewed as foundational to the overall
health of the society. The health crises of the twenties and thirties — when
the lives of millions of people were shortened by preventable diseases of
lifestyle — have mostly been replaced by broad corporate initiatives to reduce
stress and burnout. Technology Attachment Disorder (TAD) is evident in about
40 percent of the population in British Columbia. The main symptom of TAD — an
inability to communicate face-to-face — is a consequence of the imperative for
intensive digital engagement and virtual activity. Thus, while technology is a
cornerstone feature of the delivery of educational programs, we recognize that
technology immersion cannot be the sole method of educational and employment
participation.</p>
<p>In the lower mainland, most people live in large housing complexes with
attached medical clinics and care facilities. Most of these facilities are
operated by Cinnadella or its subsidiaries. Virtual travel is the norm for
clients at every age. With the exception of the few remaining Liberal Arts
universities, post-secondary campuses no longer exist. Instead, clients
interact through the virtual network. Educators help to prioritize, streamline,
and develop the experiences of clients. Educational models focus on efficiency,
performance, and economic outcomes. For clients today, the classroom is the
world (both real and virtual), education is a means to improve economic
viability, and educators are guides.</p>

<h1>A Day in the Life of a Client</h1>
<p>Robert Childan meanders through the streets of Oslo, ruminating about his
future. He has just finished high school and must decide – soon – which of
many bewildering paths to follow. He enters the gate of Frogner Park, with its
sculpture garden crowned by the totemic <em>Monolith</em>. The horizon beyond is
dominated by the massive tower of Highcastle, the educational governance
corporation. The granite facade of Highcastle is incised, above the entrance
arch, with words that Robert cannot read from where he is standing. But he
already knows what they say; after all, he’s been hearing them all his life:</p>
<blockquote>
There is a tendency in our planning to confuse the unfamiliar with the
improbable.  The contingency we have not considered seriously looks
strange; what looks strange is thought improbable; what is improbable need
not be considered seriously.</blockquote>
<p>Planning, thinking, adjusting. It’s all he ever seems to do. He knows he should
be excited by the future, by the prospect of entertaining strange and
improbable futures. But he’s overwhelmed as well. So many choices, each one
like a branch on some infinitely gnarled tree. He’s not sure that he will find
the right niche, make the right choices, winnow through the labyrinth of
branches to find a single shimmering leaf to call his own.</p>
<p>He knows this much: he cherishes his friends. Their times together in virtual
space, in the city, and on the road have been the best moments of his life. He
wonders about the mess his life might be were it not for Tagomi and Frank. And
yet he knows their paths will diverge – sometime, and probably soon – as they
each pursue their career trajectories. Even now he can see it happening:
Robert’s bursary from Cinnadella (his mother works there) is contingent upon
the corporation approving his educational choices. He cannot simply enrol in
whatever he would like. He has made deals already, and he is bound by them. He
thinks there will be many more to come.</p>
<p>Robert passes a small group of elderly park visitors. A woman at the head of
their procession is holding a sign. It says “In remembrance of those who died
at Pearl Harbor: 100 years.” Robert ambles beyond them, finds a vacant bench,
and sits down. Look, he says to himself, this is not the end of the world. Just
get started. You never know, it might be fun.</p>
<p>He blinks twice in rapid succession and his contact lenses activate. He scrolls
through the contacts list provided by Cinnadella, finds the name of the client
recruiter, and activates a holo-chat. The park fades from view. Juliana, a
Highcastle agent, comes forward to greet him. Above Juliana’s head he can see
Highcastle’s tagline, “your educational match is just around the world.” Robert
wonders where in the world he might end up.</p>
<p>Juliana and Robert chat for more than forty minutes. She seems to sense his
reluctance, his uncertainty. She begins with broad ideas (Where does he want to
go? What does he like to do?), then incrementally leads the conversation toward
concrete plans and goals. Robert starts to feel more comfortable. He broaches
the idea of working on social justice issues, a passion he and his mother
share.</p>
<p>Juliana tells Robert about Cinnadella’s International Social Justice (ISJ)
program in which clients travel to a number of hot zones – areas of poverty,
political instability, or environmental upheaval. Juliana mentions a project in
Canada, working with migratory birds at a place called Boundary Bay. That
sounds intriguing to Robert, but he is particularly interested in the water
wars that still affect a number of equatorial nations. Juliana confirms that
indeed, in this program he can travel to these places. She reminds him that the
ISJ program is on Cinnadella’s list of approved curriculum.</p>
<p>They end the visit with Juliana’s suggestion that Robert take the next step:
talking to a program facilitator. He agrees that he will do so, then signs off.
As his lenses recalibrate to the park with its lovely, totemic sculptures,
Robert wonders where his friends are on this cold but clear afternoon. He
resolves to talk to them before they all make decisions. Perhaps they can stay
together for a little while.</p>
<p>As Robert makes his way out of the park, he glimpses the procession again. They
are huddled together, moving slowly, and their dark clothing almost blends with
the stone of the sculptures. They could be sculptures, he thinks, frozen in
time.</p>
