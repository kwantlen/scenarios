<h1 class="title">Juliana’s Scenario</h1>

<p>A broad shift in global politics is underway. The turbulence of unconstrained
markets has been harnessed, finally, by social movements focused on the
provision of basic human needs. The scrabbling of nations for control of
natural resources has given way to more collaborative strategies and practices.
The water wars are over. Global warming has brought more drought but also has
encouraged greater gumption and cooperation. Health care and educational
initiatives have begun to focus on regional approaches and to emphasize the
role of autonomy and sustainability. In British Columbia, the delivery of
educational programs is streamlined and integrated by local stakeholders
working with government partners. Beginning in kindergarten and continuing
through the spectrum of adult learning, each learner works with a sustained and
customized learning portfolio. The goals of educators and the initiatives of
learners are closely entwined.</p>
<p>With few exceptions, education is free. The connected themes of career skill
and personal development have become integrated into educational models at
every level. The primary and secondary systems, as well as the first two years
of post-secondary education, are funded entirely by the provincial tax base and
provide general education for all. Post-secondary learners pay nominal fees for
the latter two years of degree programs and for graduate school. Systematic
approaches to lifelong learning are the key drivers of the education system.</p>
<p>A single public post-secondary University (Lower Mainland University, LMU) and
a single public trades and technology school (the BC Institute of Technology)
serve British Columbia. In the private sphere, The University of British
Columbia caters to specialized and professional programs. All other former
post-secondary institutions – Simon Fraser University, Kwantlen Polytechnic
University, Langara College, Vancouver Community College, and so on — were
amalgamated into LMU more than 20 years ago. The four campuses of the former
Kwantlen Polytechnic University now serve as satellite sites for LMU. The
former Langley campus serves as LMU’s Centre for Oenology and the former Surrey
campus is the Centre for Business Alignment. The two other former campuses,
Cloverdale and Richmond, remain true to their original purpose but are not part
of LMU: the former Cloverdale campus is BCIT’s hub south of the Fraser, and the
former Richmond campus is the centrepiece of the private Highcastle School of
Design.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education and LMU work together closely and are, in many ways,
indistinguishable. Credentialing is managed by the Ministry and matching
services are provided by LMU. A government administrator is the Chief Operating
Officer of LMU. The Dean of Oenology is jointly appointed to both the
university and the provincial Ministry of Education. Admissions and transfer
services (the former BCCAT, now long gone) are integrated at LMU, which handles
the complexities of an integrated provincial, federal and global post-secondary
system. Internationally, broad-based agreements between educational
institutions allow for online and in-person opportunities for learners to build
their educational profiles and to follow diverse opportunities. While industry
plays a key role in the development of educational credentials in both local
and global contexts, LMU also maintains a broad range of programs focused on
the historical, cultural and personal themes that universities have cherished
since their inception.</p>
<p>One concrete result of the turbulence and successful navigation of the previous
two decades has been the broad recognition of education as an integrative
process of lifelong learning. Whereas previous generations paid lip service to
notions of lifelong learning and personal development, we now know that we
neglect these themes at our peril. We’ve learned — from the economic upheavals
of 2014 and 2019, from the water wars that plagued us in the twenties — that
the essence of global citizenship is personal development. Sweeping changes to
mental health legislation have led to the deliberate embedding of personal
development as the core of formal education. Moreover, learners typically
remain involved in some type of educational initiative for most of their lives.
An extensive array of post-baccalaureate programs offer a multitude of ways to
fuse educational plans with career activities and personal goals.</p>
<p>Instructors within educational institutions widely view their role — at every
level — as founded upon principles of facilitation, mentorship, and learner
advocacy. Content is ubiquitous and free. The role of educators, therefore, is
to contextualize content and to work with learners to codify their learning by
way of practical application. Technology facilitates much of this process. With
broadband access approaching 100 percent (except in some areas still affected
by the heat storms of the last decade), learners initiate their Digital
Educational Portfolios in kindergarten. Learner portfolios are maintained
throughout the life of each learner and serve to document successes,
reflections, and general experiences within the educational sphere. There are
no grades. Instead, collaborative assessments and self-assessments are used to
track student progress. In British Columbia, LMU manages the portfolios and
makes the data accessible to learners wherever they are. The User Data Access
legislation ensures that learners own and have access to their materials.</p>
<p>Recreation and leisure activity are viewed as foundational to personal
development and to the overall health of the society. All citizens are
encouraged to pursue leisure activities and to integrate those activities into
their daily schedules. The health crises of the twenties and thirties — when
the lives of millions of people were shortened by preventable diseases of
lifestyle — have mostly been replaced by broad social initiatives that
facilitate health and leisure activities in local communities. However, some
health challenges persist: Technology Attachment Disorder (TAD) is still
evident in about 20 percent of the population in British Columbia. The main
symptom of TAD — an inability to communicate face-to-face — has led to many new
treatment strategies, but our progress has been slow and the problem persists.
Educational programs and workplaces include prevention-based approaches to
minimize the probability of TAD. Thus, while technology is a cornerstone
feature of the delivery of educational programs, we recognize that technology
immersion must be balanced with interpersonal experience.</p>
<p>In the lower mainland, most people live in large housing complexes with
attached medical clinics, care facilities, and schools. A well-developed
transportation infrastructure provides for self-driving vehicles, an advanced
light rail system, and person-powered bikes. Both personal and public
transportation provide a full complement of digital services. With the fossil
fuel crises of the twenties now well behind us, both local and international
travel are the norm for learners at every age. Schools act as nodes for
interaction within a wide network of learner activities that extend beyond the
school itself. The classroom is a meeting place and project space for learners
to bring together their diverse activities and to share with peers. The
educator as facilitator helps to develop and nurture the experiences of
learners. Educational models have moved beyond the old hierarchies of
instructor authority and expertise. For learners today, the classroom is the
world, the school is their way of traveling through that world, and the
facilitator is a traveling companion.</p>

<h1>A Day in the Life of a Learner</h1>
<p>Juliana Frink is woken by the chime of her alarm. The blinds begin to modulate
the incoming light, the room grows brighter. She swings her feet to the floor,
rises from the bed, and checks the wall display. Three meetings are listed
there: one with her cohort at LMU, one with her project partner, and one with
her fitness group. She gazes outside, searches the sky for signs of rain, and
smiles in anticipation of yet another unseasonably warm day. The sands at
Boundary Bay will be dry again today, and she looks forward to spending time at
the shore with her friends from LMU. Perhaps they will finish stage two of the
desalination study by the end of the afternoon. Juliana thinks of the weeks
ahead – publishing, presenting, traveling – and hopes that her work on the
study will be finished soon. After all, her trip to Patagonia is on the horizon
and she hasn’t yet begun to finalize her plans. Six months in the mountains is
not the kind of thing you can just show up for.</p>
<p>Juliana sends a quick note to Tagomi, her project partner, to remind her about
their plans to work on portfolio assessments today. It’s as much a reminder for
Juliana as for Tagomi; working on the assessments provides precisely the kind
of focus that Juliana needs right now to balance the various commitments of her
life. The self-assessments help her accomplish that goal. Working with Tagomi
on self-reflection and self-assessment is Juliana’s way of staying in touch
with herself, her needs and goals, her future. She’s used the portfolio
assessments in this way since she was a teenager in Oslo, and now that she’s
45, her method seems to have served her well.</p>
<p>Four interconnected careers in business and ecology have unfolded in her life,
and each step along these paths has brought her closer to herself, her family,
and to the society in which she lives. Still, there’s much more to do, much
more to see. Her boys, Frank and Robert, are now well along their own paths,
making their way through service learning projects, building careers in design
and urban planning, soaking up experiences the way that shore plants at
Boundary Bay flourish with the incoming tide. Juliana pauses, remembers her
Dad’s generation – careers of exigency, economic urgency, necessary but not
impassioned choices – and feels grateful that at long last humanity seems to
have been smart enough to get some things right. Whatever turns her life takes,
wherever she finds herself, she will be the author of that journey. Her
accomplishments – and indeed, her failures too – will be hers alone to shape
and to hold.</p>
<p>She notices an item on the news scroll: today is the hundredth annniversary of
the Pearl Harbor attack. She taps the item, scans the details, and pauses at a
quotation that catches her eye. It’s from an old book about the attack, written
by a scholar now long dead. As Juliana reads, she finds in the quotation a kind
of wisdom. It says:</p>
<blockquote>
There is a tendency in our planning to confuse the unfamiliar with the
improbable.  The contingency we have not considered seriously looks
strange; what looks strange is thought improbable; what is improbable need
not be considered seriously.</blockquote>
<p>Juliana taps the timeline on the wall display, drags a waypoint to it from the
map, and places her order at the Cinnadella café. Ruminating about the unfamiliar and the
improbable, she gets moving, hoping she can make it to the café in time to meet
Tagomi for breakfast.</p>
